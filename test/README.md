# TMake Testing Suite

For TMake we have 2 types of tests.

1. Standalone Tests : These are tests that are usually ran as CLI's and serve more as a rudimentary check/debug application
2. Regression Tests : These tests are what keep TMake bug free. As TMake matures we will add more and more tests. The entire regression suite will also be required to pass successfully to be able to commit to master.
